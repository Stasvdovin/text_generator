#Model Description: openai-gpt is a transformer-based language model created and released by OpenAI. The model is a causal (unidirectional) transformer pre-trained using language modeling on a large corpus with long range dependencies.
#Potential downstream uses of this model include tasks that leverage language models. In the associated paper, the model developers discuss evaluations of the model for tasks including natural language inference (NLI), question answering, semantic similarity, and text classification.
